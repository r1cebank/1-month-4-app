## Why

I am a computer engineer üòÅ, other than my day job there is really no place I could practice programming for my own interests. So I came up with the 1 month 4 app challenge which I hope I can keep doing it for the rest of my career. I think this will be a great learning experience for me.

## Rules

These are the **rules** that I will obey over the course of the challenge.

0.	Must be iOS/Android application (backend, web, tools are not accepted)
1. Must use latest mobile technologies (Swift, Ionic, Android SDK)
2. Must include at least one interesting feature (calculator does not count as interesting feature)
3. Idea does not have to be original, recreating existing apps is allowed
4. Usage of existing code (written by me or others) is forbidden.
5. By the end of the month, all 4 apps should be in "Ready for review" state in Apple App Store or live in Google Play Store
